            Looks like a weird mix of animal to know right? the Jerboa has a little bit of diffenr animal, a rabbt's ear, a pig's nose, a kangaroo's legs, and the body of a rat. But there is more to the jerboa than is cute apperance, it the power of its legs. It can jump accross great distenince.

            So where did most of it traits come from through evoultion? the jerboa habiat is in the desert in northwest China and south Mongolia, this has their fur to become a browish color to help with blending with sand. Its tail serve a helpful role of keeping it blanced while standing upright. The Soles of it feet are used to keep a firm grip on the sand to prevent it from slipping. A really cool part of theri biology is how they don't need to drink water, they instead get it from plants and insects they eat.

            As memention, it jumpping ablity is out of this world. It can use it leg like springs to jump away to doge attacks from preadtors like brids of prey while it out looking for bugs to eat. It will even sometimes hop in a way to fake out preadtors to lose them. The most increadble thing about their jumping ablity is how some are able to leap up six feet at the heightest point of its jump. They can jump over the heads of most people, or on your face if you are over six feet.

              These are such a interesting creature to observe from it adorable and weird looks and how it can hop arround. Though there is the sad fact that they are an endanger species and scitenitst have no idea what are their current population is. The main driving factors that are putting theminto the endanger list is droughts, lacking in water sources, a large increased in grazing livestocks that is caused by humans, and of course local domestic cats. So while you are in the area these critters hang out and own a cat, keep a close eye on them so they don't go out to get you a rare prize.

        <p>Guppies are a well known pet that are often found in fish tanks as a nice pet for kids to take care of. They also known to have large swarm of children when they breed. Though it could be seen as surprising to learned how violent these silly looking fishes can be.</p>

            It is quite often that after a guppy give birth, she will start eating her own fry. This is known as fulial cannibalism, it is when the adult end up killing and eating their own young.
            Researcher are not exactly sure why guppy do this, there are mutlpile possible reasoning why these creatures will eat there own young.
            </p>
            <p>
                One source of this canblistic nature could be a form of population control, to control the amount of fishes there are in the tank. They will consume more of their own kind if there and large increase in the amount of fishes in the tank and it will not be able to support all of them. Another reasoning why these creature will resort to eating their own young will have to be how it a form of getting rid of fries that are deemed too unfit to survive. There could be something wrong that the Guppies noticed about their young and so they decided to eat instead of letting it grow up draining resources before dying. This kind of canblism is very common in most animals like wolves.

            <p>
                All these are very likely reasoning why guppies will try to eat their own young. Though as much as we can terorise and ponder, it very hard to tell if there is a real reason to why these animal eat their own young, or if guppies are so one minded with hunger what they just can not tell the differnice between their own fry and fish food. Though it is kind of humorious the a corcidile is a much more motherly animal to not just their own young, but to the offspring of other animals that hatched with their eggs than a guppy and her fries.

                Here is a TED-Ed video going on about cannibalism in other animal showing how common this kind of nature is found in most animals. It is what inspired me to write this article.

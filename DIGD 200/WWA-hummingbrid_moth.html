            At frist it looks just like a bird, but that is actually a type of moth. Its a Hummingbrid Moth, named so due to it uncanny resmemblance to a humming brid when not taken time to closely obesrve it. What could be the reasons the brought this doupleganger into existence?

            The hummingbrid moth have a plump body, the tip of their tail spreads out just like a fan(it look kinda like a brid). another interesting way how they can be can be confused for their brid counterpart is by sound. Their wings are mostly clear with some colors on the trims.They emmit a simliar hum the hummingbrid while flying. Animals that are distincely related to each other can share many common traits happen many time over history. This weird genetic evoultion is known as convergent evoulation. The Hummingbrid moths not only just looks like the real deal, but they also act like they are act like them too.

            The hummingbrid moth would hover around flowers just like a real hummingbrid sucking the nectar by using the proboscis, the long straw-like object on their head. To gernerate to lift to hover by the flowers, it faps its wings in a figure-eight pattern. Though due to their wings being rigid, they will have to generate a higher ammount of wing beats per second to hover than both hummingbrid and bat combined.

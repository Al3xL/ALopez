            They are the clean up crew of the animal kingdom, they will remove the dung in the world by burrying it, eating it, or laying their eggs in it for them to eat. An example of this will have to be ones that ones mind often go to when thinking about dung beetles, Dung-roller scarabs. These creatures have an unique mating habbit. A mating pair will make a large ball of dung and then roll it off to a safe place, away. Once they have safely moved the ball, they will burry the ball and female then lay a single egg in side. The pair will contuine this process four more times. Luckly for them their eyes are sensitive to light to the point that they can use moon light to see to contuine working at the night.

Besides from from cleaning up the cow pats, they also good for getting rid of dungs that flies would use for habitat for flies. Dung beetles will go after feashly placed manure draining the moisture from it before burrying it. This will help making the soil rich, but it also makes it so that flies will not be able to lay their eggs in there lowering the negative effects of the pests.

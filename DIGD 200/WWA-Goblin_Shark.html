            This shark that looks like it floped out of the nightmares of little children is known as a goblin shark, it has pinkish grey flabby fleash, with rounded fins, and a caudal tail fin. One of their most noticible trait is their long, flat snout and long sharp teeth. One of the most interesting fact about goblin sharks is how the used their back rows teeths, while for most sharks they are used to replace ones the broken off goblin shark used them to eat. I will share to you more information of one the many facninating creature found where the light no longer shine in the ocean.

                This shark is not the kind that will be often find while traveling on boat or near the shore. They live deep under water, commonly being somewhere between 885 ft to 3149 ft, though there are some accounts of goblin sharks being found in water around 311 ft to 449 ft. So even in the highest water level they are sometime found in they will not often interact with humans.

                Now due to how deep these sharks live under water, light does not travel to them making it imposible to see unless with certain adpatation. So how do these shark catch their prey if they can't see them. Goblin sharks has aspecial sense system called ampullae of Lorenzini that can be found in its sount to use electrodetection of prey. The jaws of the shark is made for rapid projecion of bite to help catching prey. This happen due to having a double set of ligaments at the mandibular joints that when relaxed, the jaw is projected foward. It uses it long front teeth as a way to capture prey before the its small teeth in the back rows to crush its prey to death. By the structure of it jaws, it can be suggested that the diet of the shark is mostly conist of soft body prey like shrimps and squids.
